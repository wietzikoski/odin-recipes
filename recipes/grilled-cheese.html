        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Bread</em> - a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
            <li><em>Butter</em> - use a generous &frac12; Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
            <li><em>Cheese</em> - we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Butter the toast</em>- spread &frac12; Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li><em>Heat Skillet</em>- place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275ËšF. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</li>
            <li><em>Add cheese</em>- stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
            <li><em>Brown the toast</em>- Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
            <li><em>Serve</em>- cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
