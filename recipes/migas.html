 <h2>Ingredients</h2>   
 <ul>
    <li>8 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 plum tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>Vegetable, canola, or peanut oil, for frying</li>
    <li>16 corn tortillas, 8 cut into 1 &frac12; by &frac34;mi-inch strips (see note), 8 left whole and warmed in a dry hot skillet just before serving</li>
    <li>1 medium Poblano pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 serrano chilies or 1 jalapeño, stemmed and finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Mexican hot sauce, for serving</li>
    <li>Refried beans and sliced avocado, for serving</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Directions</h2>
 <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk eggs with 2 generous pinches of salt and set aside. In a medium bowl, toss tomato with a generous pinch of salt, then transfer tomatoes to a strainer and set over bowl to drain.</li>
    <li>In a medium saucepan, heat about 2 inches of oil to 350°F (180°C). Add tortilla strips and cook, agitating and flipping them constantly with a wire mesh spider, until bubbles slow to a trickle and chips are pale golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate, season with salt, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat 3 tablespoons (45ml) oil in a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add Poblano, serrano or jalapeño, and onion and cook, stirring, until fully softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Lower heat to medium-low, add eggs, and cook, stirring constantly, until curds are just starting to form throughout, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add &frac34; of the tortilla chips and continue to cook eggs until they are still soft but nearly cooked, about 5 minutes longer. Add tomato and remaining tortilla chips and cook until eggs are softly scrambled and just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer immediately to a bowl to halt cooking. Serve right away on top of warmed whole tortillas with hot sauce, refried beans, and avocado.</li>
